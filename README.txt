== Description ==

BulletProof Checkout Gateway seamlessly integrates 3DS chargeback prevention technology with WooCommerce to accept secure credit card payments and prevent chargebacks. Our payment gateway allows customers to make safe and secure payments using their credit cards.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

### What is the distinction between Chargeback Prevention and Chargeback Protection? 
- "Chargeback prevention" refers to a proactive strategy to avoid receiving a chargeback and the associated difficulties of disputing and winning it. The use of 3DS provides a proactive, preventative approach to avoid fraud-based chargebacks and prevent them from being reported to your merchant account.

"Chargeback protection" includes a range of services and tools that help you deal with an actual chargeback reported to your merchant account and achieve the best possible outcome.


###What if we already have a company that is managing our chargebacks?
- 3DS provides a proactive preventative approach so that you can avoid fraud-based chargebacks and save time and money by not receiving them. 

You can use our 3DS chargeback prevention solution synergistically alongside any other chargeback protection solution to address chargebacks outside the scope of 3DS

We also offer chargeback protection services that are integrated into our payment gateway.


### Why is BulletProof Checkout the best option for 3DS?
- We are the world’s first fully featured 3DS gateway. All of our payment methods boast easy-to-use 3DS technology without the need for any programming. 

We have addressed the most common reasons why merchants have yet to entirely embrace 3DS technology at the checkout and provided a means to control the 3DS checkout experience.


### Can I use BulletProof Checkout payment gateway alongside my current processor?
